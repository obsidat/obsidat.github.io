      An Obsidian file. Its file path, vault name, and contents are encrypted using a randomly generated
      passphrase.
      
      The rkey is `vault_tid || file_tid` (16 bytes, base32-sortable, always 26 characters) but this could
      change later.
      
      The file TID is not accurate to record or file creation date.
