    description: >-
      An Obsidian file. Its file path, vault name, and contents are encrypted using a passphrase
      stored in the settings of the atproto-obsidian-sync Obsidian plugin.

      Before encrypting, the passphrase is concatenated with this record's rkey to make it unique per-file.

      Record Key is blake3 hash of `lower(filePath) || ':' || lower(vaultName) || ':' || passphrase || ':' || salt`
      The salt is currently hardcoded in the plugin but this may change in the future.
